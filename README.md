# KLayout-Blender
Rendering Quantum Chip using Blender with KLayout for layout design.  
I have render two type of chip and one is circular transmon qubit that is presented as a chip for practice , to get familiar with the KLayout and Blender.  
This repo contain three GDS file and Three blender file and one Jupyter Notebook file for createing a complete quantum chip and exports it to GDS.  
(1) Quantiqo Full Chip - Export the GDS design using the Qiskit-Metal  
(2) 4 Qubit Demo Chip - Export the GDS Design using Qiskit-Metal  
(3) Circular Transmon Qubit - GDS design already available in KLayout in Qubit Library
